- 👋 Hi, I’m @gracechhabra
- 👀 I’m interested in artificial intelligence, machine learning, biology, and computer science in general. I am hoping to create computer science projects related to medicine.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python and how to create a NBA stat tracker!
- 💞️ I'm passionate about both medicine and coding, and I'm eager to learn and contribute to projects in these areas.  As a beginner, I'm especially interested in finding collaborative opportunities where I can learn from experienced people.
